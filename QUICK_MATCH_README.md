# Unified Quick Match System

## üéØ Overview

The new Unified Quick Match system transforms career matching from a static form-based experience into an intelligent, conversational AI-powered platform that leverages existing user profile data and generates high-quality, personalized matches.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Core Components**

1. **UnifiedQuickMatch Component** (`components/quick-match-unified.tsx`)
   - Single component for all domains (Engineers, Software, Finance)
   - LLM-powered conversation flow
   - Swipeable match interface
   - Real-time profile building

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/quick-match/initialize` - Initialize session with user profile
   - `/api/quick-match/conversation` - Handle LLM conversations
   - `/api/quick-match/generate` - Generate AI-powered matches

3. **Database Schema**
   - `quick_match_sessions` table for session persistence
   - JSONB fields for flexible data storage

## üîÑ User Flow

### **Step 1: Profile Assessment**
- Auto-populates from existing onboarding data
- Shows user their current profile summary
- Identifies missing information for conversation

### **Step 2: LLM Conversation**
- Natural, contextual questions based on existing data
- References user's background: "I see you're energized by data analysis..."
- Extracts skills, interests, and preferences through dialogue
- Builds comprehensive profile through conversation

### **Step 3: Preferences Refinement**
- Only asks questions not covered by onboarding
- Smart defaults based on existing data
- Domain-specific preferences

### **Step 4: AI-Generated Matches**
- LLM generates 8-12 high-quality matches
- Real companies with specific roles
- Detailed match explanations
- Swipeable interface for exploration

## üß† LLM Integration

### **Conversation Engine**
```typescript
// Generates contextual questions
const aiResponse = await generateAIResponse(profile, conversation, domain);

// Example prompt:
"You are an AI career advisor helping a 2025 Computer Science student find their ideal career path. 
User Profile: [detailed profile data]
Generate a natural, engaging follow-up question to learn more about their career preferences."
```

### **Smart Matching**
```typescript
// Generates personalized matches
const matches = await generateMatches(profile, domain);

// LLM prompt includes:
// - User's energy profile and values
// - Skills and interests from conversation
// - Career goals and constraints
// - Domain-specific requirements
```

## üìä Data Flow

### **Profile Building**

4. **Enhanced Profile**: Comprehensive user profile for matching

### **Match Generation**
1. **Profile Analysis**: LLM analyzes user profile and preferences
